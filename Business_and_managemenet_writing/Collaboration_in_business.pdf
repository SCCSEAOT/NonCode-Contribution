Collaboration in the Company
According to the research, first, the company needs to find the reason for the poor productivity in the organization. The company needs to categorize different teams for some special operations(Hartley, 2015). The company hired a leader to direct the whole team. There are some steps where the company gets full productivity through their work. The leader needs to motivate all the workers to communicate. Communication can solve a lot of problems and also increases productivity. When the company creates a job plan, it should organize a meeting. The target of the meeting must establish different steps for executing all the strategies for the business. The new members can understand where they have to improve and what the purpose of improvement is. Some strategies are followed by the company to execute every new project. The leaders have to explain everything to the newcomers through better communication. The company needs to hire some specialists who can train all the new members as well as the existing members for a particular project. The new members have no ideas about the objectives that are taken by the company itself. It is the right time to train all the members properly to handle all the sections of the company. Some basic knowledge is important for any project and the HR needs to select the employees depending on their basic knowledge of the employees. Basic knowledge is important to reach the advanced portion of a particular skill because if the candidates have no idea about the basic knowledge, they cannot understand the advanced concepts.A good work environment is required to produce several innovative things. The project manager needs to be communicative and his/her behaviour must be gentle to the employees(Horton, 2016). Sometimes the employees get demotivated because of the hectic schedule. At this time, they need some relaxation. The company can organize some annual parties for the employees. Some indoor games or a cafeteria may be a good choice for relaxation. These things can increase the interaction between the employees and the higher post officers of the company. Sometimes it reduces conflicts between the teams and they can share their experiences. The leader can see good cooperation between all the members and also it increases productivity. A fresh mind can think of a lot of new innovative ideas and also it helps to deal with a lot of problems that can ruin the natural structure of a business management system(Liddle, 2017). Most importantly, a dedicated mindset can be the best reason for creating and applying innovative strategies to the business.
